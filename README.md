# Natural-language-processing---text-mining

This project is part of my data science class team project. One task was to use supervised machine learning methods (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree) and NLP (Bag of Words, TFIDF) to classify segments of books by authors and compare their performance with each other. The other task was to produce similar text clusters using unsupervied methods (KMEANS,Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering) and NLP and compare their performances with each other.
